## Summary

A Distinguishable Assets Registry is a contract that tracks ownership of, and information about a set of assets.

See https://github.com/decentraland/erc821 for a reference implementation.

See the "Revisions" section for a history of this ERC.

## Abstract

Tracking the ownership of physical or digital distinguishable items on a blockchain has a broad range of applications, ranging from virtual collectibles to physical art pieces. This proposal aims at standardizing a way to reference distinguishable assets along with the foreseeable required operations and interfaces for effective management of those assets on a blockchain.

## Introduction

The number of virtual collectibles tracked on the Ethereum blockchain is rapidly growing, creating a demand for a more robust standard for distinguishable digital assets. This proposal suggests improvements to the vocabulary used to refer to such assets, and attempts to provide a solid and future-proof reference implementation of the basic functionality needed. This EIP also proposes better naming conventions and vocabulary for the different components of the NFT economy: the assets, the NFTs (representations of those assets on the blockchain), the DARs (the contracts registering such assets), distinguishing ownership from holding addresses, and more.

See also: ERC #721, ERC #20, ERC #223, and ERC #777.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Specification

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a distinguishable asset that has a unique representation as a register in a smart contract. This proposal specifies such contracts, referenced as Distinguishable Asset Registries, or DARs.

DARs can be identified by the blockchain in which they were deployed, and the 160-bit address of the contract instance. NFTs are identified by an ID, a 256 bit number, which MAY correspond to some cryptographic hash of the non-fungible's natural key.

NFTs SHOULD be referenced by a URI that follows this schema:

    nft://<chain's common name>/<DAR's address>/<NFT's ID>

The NFT's ID SHOULD have a hint that helps to decode it. For instance, if the encoding of the number is in hexadecimal, the NFTâ€™s ID SHOULD start with `0x`. The DAR's address SHOULD follow the checksum by casing as proposed on #55.

Some common names for Ethereum blockchains are:

* `ethereum`, `livenet`, or `mainnet`
* `ropsten`, `testnet`
* `kovan`
* `rinkeby`

Some examples of NFT URIs follow:

* nft://ethereum/0x36fc2821C1dBa31Ed04682B2277c89f33fD885b7/0
* nft://ropsten/0x36fc2821C1dBa31Ed04682B2277c89f33fD885b7/0xfaa5be24e996feadf4c96b905af2c77c456e2debd075bab4d8fd5f70f209de44
Every NFT MUST have a `holder` address associated with it. NFTs associated with the null address are assumed non-existent or destroyed.

A holder MAY assign one or multiple `operator` addresses. These addresses MUST be able to transfer any asset of the holder.

Any NFT MAY have a `string` value associated with it, named `data`, or `metadata`. This associated data SHOULD contain a URL to fetch information related to the NFT. This URL SHOULD have the following subpaths:

* `name`
* `image`
* `description`

This is intended to provide any NFT-capable dApp with enough information to display the NFT in its UI.

DARs MAY trigger `Update` events, signaling that the URL for associated data has changed.

DARs MUST trigger `Transfer` events every time a NFT's `holder` changes. This might happen under three circumstances:

* A NFT is created. In this case, the `from` value of the `Transfer` event MUST be the zero address.
* A NFT is transferred to a new user.
* A NFT is destroyed. In this case, the `to` value of the `Transfer` event MUST be the zero address.

`Transfer` events MUST NOT simultaneously have a zero value in both the `from` and `to` fields (this means, the same `Transfer` event can't both create and destroy a token).

### DAR global methods

* `name`: `string`
* `symbol`: `string`
* `description`: `string`
* `totalSupply`: `uint256`

These properties follow the standards of #20 and introduces a `description`. These are all `view` functions.

### NFT getter methods

#### `exists(uint256 assetId):bool`

This method returns a boolean value, `true` if the asset identified with the given `assetId` exists under this DAR. This method MUST NOT throw.

#### `holderOf(uint256 assetId):address`

This method returns the `address` of the holder of the NFT. This method MUST NOT throw. If the `assetId` does not exist, the return value MUST be the null address.

#### `safeHolderOf(uint256 assetId):address`

This method returns the `address` of the holder of the NFT. This method MUST throw if the `assetId` does not exist.

#### `assetData(uint256 assetId):string`

This method returns data associated with the NFT. This method MUST NOT throw. This method MAY return an empty string if the NFT has no associated data with it. This method MUST return an empty string if the NFT does not exist.

### Holder-centric getter methods

#### `assetCount(address holder):uint256`

This method returns the amount of NFTs held by the `holder` address under this DAR. This method MUST not throw.

#### `assetByIndex(address holder, uint256 index):uint256`

This method returns the ID of the `index`th NFT held by the `holder` address under this DAR, when all the IDs of the NFTs held by such address are stored as an array.

This method MUST throw if `assetCount(holder) >= index`. This method MUST throw if `index >= 2^128`.

The DAR MAY change the order assigned to any NFT held by a particular address.

This method is expected to be used by other contracts to iterate through a `holder`'s assets. Contracts implementing such iterations SHOULD be aware of race conditions that might occur, if this iteration happens over multiple transactions.

#### `assetsOf(address holder):uint256[]`

This method returns an array of IDs of the NFTs held by `holder`. This method MUST NOT throw.

### Operator getters

#### `isOperatorAuthorizedBy(address operator, address holder):bool`

This method returns `true` if `holder` has called the method `authorizeOperator` with parameters `(operator, true)` and has not called `authorizeOperator(operator, false)` afterwards. This method returns `false` otherwise.

This method MUST return `true` if `operator == holder`.

This method MUST NOT throw.

### Transfers

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)`

Transfers holding of the NFT referenced by `assetId` from `holderOf(assetId)` to the address `to`.

`to` MUST NOT be the zero address. If `to` is the zero address, the call MUST throw.

`isOperatorAuthorizedBy(msg.sender, holderOf(assetId))` MUST return true as a precondition. 

This means that the `msg.sender` MUST be `holderOf(assetId)` or an authorized operator.

If the NFT referenced by `assetId` does not exist, then the call MUST throw.

If `to` is a contract's address, this call MUST call the `onAssetReceived` method on the contract implementing `IAssetHolder` as returned by an EIP #820 lookup on the `to` address. Such a call MUST happen **after** the NFT has been transferred.

If `to` is a contract's address, and the EIP #820 lookup **does not** return an address implementing `IAssetHolder`, this call MUST NOT call `onAssetReceived` returned by the EIP #820 lookup and it MUST throw.

If the call doesn't throw, it triggers the event `Transfer` with the following parameters:

* from: value of `holderOf(assetId)` before the call
* to: the `to` argument
* assetId: the `assetId` argument
* operator: `msg.sender`
* userData: the `userData` argument
* operatorData: the `operatorData` argument

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transfer(to, assetId, EMPTY_BYTES, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transfer(to, assetId, EMPTY_BYTES, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

### Authorization

#### `authorizeOperator(address operator, bool authorized)`

If `authorized` is `true`, allows `operator` to `transfer` any NFT held by `msg.sender`.

This method MUST throw if `operator` is the zero address. This method MUST throw if `authorized` is true and `operator` is already authorized by the sender. This method MUST throw if `authorized` is false and `operator` is unauthorized.

This method MUST throw if `msg.sender == operator`.

This method MUST trigger an `AuthorizeOperator` event if it doesn't throw.

### Events

interface AssetRegistryEvents {
  event Transfer(
    address indexed from,

## Design goals

### Staying up to date with the latest standards

Standards like ERC #820 and ERC #777 represent the latest best practices on token standards. #777 introduces better vocabulary surrounding the `approve` method and accommodates the fact that successful contracts using `approve` end up asking the user to "approve any transfer", by calling `approve(2^256-1)`.

ERC #820 is the latest iteration of #672, a standard that allows contracts to upgrade in a non-disruptive way, but without enforcing ENS to achieve this goal.

### Transfer known patterns if they apply, follow the trends that correct anti-patterns

The ERC #20 introduced a new vocabulary (`owner`, `approve`, `supply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`) and we should try to reuse as much  of that vocabulary and those patterns as possible , but only when they apply. For instance, `transferFrom` doesn't make sense for a NFT; it's intended to allow an approved agent (after `approve`) to move someone else's token, but with an NFT as described in this standard, the "`owner`" is known beforehand.

ERC #777 introduces the name `operator` to replace the functionality previously provided by `approve`. We believe this is a good change, given that widely used contracts (EtherDelta, 0x) have adopted the use of a call to `approve(2^256-1)`.

We also follow the change of nomenclature from `owner` to `holder` in an effort to distinguish the actual "owner" of an item might from a mere holder of the private key associated with the item.

### Provide a reference implementation

#20 failed to provide a reference implementation right away -- which made for the standard to be written and rewritten on multiple occasions. We provide a reference implementation from day one, along with guidance on how to extend the contract to suit the policy according to each NFT class.

Our implementation tries to follow the UNIX principle of providing mechanisms, not policy. That's why we included functions to create, update, and destroy tokens, but marked them as `internal`.

### Reduce gas costs

Whenever possible, the gas costs should be kept at a minimum.
