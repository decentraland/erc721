## Summary

A Distinguishable Assets Registry (DAR for short) is a contract that tracks ownership of, and information about a set of assets that are distinguishable from each other, and are commonly refferred to as "NFTs", for "Non Fungible Tokens".

See https://github.com/decentraland/erc821 for a reference implementation.

See the "Revisions" section for a history of this ERC.

## Abstract

Tracking the ownership of physical or digital distinguishable items on a blockchain has a broad range of applications, from virtual collectibles to physical art pieces. This proposal aims at standardizing a way to reference distinguishable assets along with the foreseeable required operations and interfaces for effective management of those assets on a blockchain.

## Introduction

The number of virtual collectibles tracked on the Ethereum blockchain is rapidly growing, creating a demand for a more robust standard for distinguishable digital assets. This proposal suggests improvements to the vocabulary used to refer to such assets, and attempts to provide a solid and future-proof reference implementation of the basic functionality needed. This EIP also proposes better naming conventions and vocabulary for the different components of the NFT economy: the assets, the NFTs (representations of those assets on the blockchain), the DARs (the contracts registering such assets), distinguishing ownership from holding addresses, and more.

See also: ERC #721, ERC #20, ERC #223, and ERC #777.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Specification

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a distinguishable asset that has a unique representation as a register in a smart contract. This proposal specifies such contracts, referenced as Distinguishable Asset Registries, or DARs. NFTs MAY also be reffered to as "deeds".

DARs can be identified by the blockchain in which they were deployed, and the 160-bit address of the contract instance. NFTs are identified by an ID, a 256 bit number, which MAY correspond to some cryptographic hash of the non-fungible's natural key.

NFTs SHOULD be referenced by a URI that follows this schema:

    nft://<chain's common name>/<DAR's address>/<NFT's ID>

The NFT's ID SHOULD have a hint that helps to decode it. For instance, if the encoding of the number is in hexadecimal, the NFT’s ID SHOULD start with `0x`. The DAR's address SHOULD follow the checksum by casing as proposed on #55.

Some common names for Ethereum blockchains are:

- `ethereum`, `livenet`, or `mainnet`
- `ropsten`, `testnet`
- `kovan`
- `rinkeby`

Some examples of NFT URIs follow:

- nft://ethereum/0xF87E31492Faf9A91B02Ee0dEAAd50d51d56D5d4d/0
- nft://ropsten/0xF87E31492Faf9A91B02Ee0dEAAd50d51d56D5d4d/0xfaa5be24e996feadf4c96b905af2c77c456e2debd075bab4d8fd5f70f209de44

Every NFT MUST have a `owner` address associated with it. NFTs associated with the null address are assumed non-existent or destroyed.

An owner MAY assign one or multiple `operator` addresses. These addresses will be able to transfer any asset of the owner.

DARs MUST trigger `Transfer` events every time a NFT's `owner` changes. This might happen under three circumstances:

- A NFT is created. In this case, the `from` value of the `Transfer` event MUST be the zero address.
- A NFT is transferred to a different owner.
- A NFT is destroyed. In this case, the `to` value of the `Transfer` event MUST be the zero address.

`Transfer` events SHALL NOT simultaneously have a zero value in both the `from` and `to` fields (this means, the same `Transfer` event can't both create and destroy a token).

#### Associated Metadata

Metadata associated with each asset is out of scope for this standard.

### DAR global methods

#### `totalSupply():uint256`

Return the total amount of assets under this DAR. This method SHALL NOT throw.

#### `supportsInterface(bytes8 interfaceId):bool`

This method returns `true` if the `interfaceId` is a supported interface (165, corresponding to 0x01ffc9a7, 821, corresponding to 0x7c0633c6, or 721 corresponding to 0x80ac58cd). This method SHALL NOT throw.

### NFT getter methods

#### `exists(uint256 assetId):bool`

This method returns a boolean value, `true` if the asset identified with the given `assetId` exists under this DAR. This method SHALL NOT throw.

#### `ownerOf(uint256 assetId):address`

This method returns the `address` of the owner of the NFT. This method SHALL NOT throw. If the `assetId` does not exist, the return value MUST be the null address.

### Owner-centric getter methods

#### `balanceOf(address owner):uint256`

This method returns the amount of NFTs held by the `owner` address under this DAR. This method MUST not throw.

#### `assetByIndex(address owner, uint256 index):uint256`

This method returns the ID of the `index`th NFT held by the `owner` address under this DAR, when all the IDs of the NFTs held by such address are stored as an array.

This method MUST throw if `assetCount(owner) >= index`. This method MUST throw if `index >= 2^128`.

The DAR MAY change the order assigned to any NFT held by a particular address.

This method is expected to be used by other contracts to iterate through an `owner`'s assets. Contracts implementing such iterations SHOULD be aware of race conditions that might occur, if this iteration happens over multiple transactions.

#### `assetsOf(address owner):uint256[]`

This method returns an array of IDs of the NFTs held by `owner`. This method SHALL NOT throw.

### Operator getters

#### `isAuthorizedBy(address operator, address owner):bool`

This method returns `true` if `owner` has called the method `authorize` with parameters `(operator, true)` and has not called `authorize(operator, false)` afterwards. This method returns `false` otherwise.

This method MUST return `true` if `operator == owner`.

This method SHALL NOT throw.

#### `isApprovedFor(address operator, uint256 assetId):bool`

This method returns `true` if `owner` has called the method `approve` with parameters `(operator, assetId)` and has not called it with a different operator value afterwards. This method returns `false` otherwise.

This method MUST return `true` if `operator == owner`.

This method SHALL NOT throw.

### Transfers

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)`

Transfers holding of the NFT referenced by `assetId` from `ownerOf(assetId)` to the address `to`.

`to` SHALL NOT be the zero address. If `to` is the zero address, the call MUST throw.

`to` SHALL NOT be `ownerOf(assetId)`. If this condition is met, the call MUST throw.

`isAuthorizedBy(msg.sender, ownerOf(assetId))` MUST return true as a precondition.

This means that the `msg.sender` MUST be `ownerOf(assetId)` or an authorized operator.

If the NFT referenced by `assetId` does not exist, then the call MUST throw.

If there was any single authorized operator (see the `approve()` method below), this authorization MUST be cleared.

If the call doesn't throw, it triggers the event `Transfer` with the following parameters:

- from: value of `ownerOf(assetId)` before the call
- to: the `to` argument
- assetId: the `assetId` argument

If `to` is a contract's address, this call MUST verify that the contract can receive the tokens. In order to do so, the method MUST do a #165 check for support to handle tokens to the target contract.
The implementation for the receiver is as follows:

```
interface IAssetHolder {
  function onAssetReceived(
    /* address _assetRegistry == msg.sender */
    uint256 _assetId,
    address _previousOwner,
    address _currentOwner,
    bytes   _userData
  ) public;
}
```

If the `supportsInterface` method call fails, the transfer must be reversed and this call MUST throw. Otherwise, the method `onAssetReceived` MUST be invoked with the corresponding information, **after** the asset has been transferred.

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transfer(to, assetId, userData, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

#### `transfer(address to, uint256 assetId)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transfer(to, assetId, EMPTY_BYTES, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

#### `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)`

Transfers holding of the NFT referenced by `assetId` from `ownerOf(assetId)` to the address `to`, iff `from == ownerOf(assetId)`.

After checking that the asset is owned by the `from` address, this method MUST behave exactly as calling `transfer(to, assetId, EMPTY_BYTES, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

#### `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 assetId, bytes userData)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transferFrom(to, assetId, userData, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

#### `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 assetId)`

Shorthand method that MUST be equivalent to calling `transferFrom(to, assetId, EMPTY_BYTES, EMPTY_BYTES)`.

### Authorization

#### `authorize(address operator, bool authorized)`

If `authorized` is `true`, allows `operator` to `transfer` any NFT held by `msg.sender`.

This method MUST throw if `operator` is the zero address. This method MUST throw if `authorized` is true and `operator` is already authorized by the sender. This method MUST throw if `authorized` is false and `operator` is unauthorized.

This method MUST throw if `msg.sender == operator`.

This method MUST trigger an `AuthorizeOperator` event if it doesn't throw.

#### `approve(address operator, uint256 assetId)`

Allow `operator` to `transfer` an asset without delegating full access to all assets.

Only the `owner` of an asset can call this method. Otherwise, the call MUST fail.

Only one address can receive `approval` at the same time. Clearing approval for a transfer can be done by setting the `operator` value to the zero address.

This method MUST trigger an `Approve` event if it doesn't throw.

### Events

```
interface AssetRegistryEvents {
  event Transfer(
    address indexed from,
    address indexed to,
    uint256 indexed assetId
  );
  event Transfer(
    address indexed from,
    address indexed to,
    uint256 indexed assetId,
    address operator,
    bytes userData
  );
  event AuthorizeOperator(
    address indexed operator,
    address indexed holder,
    bool authorized
  );
  event Approve(
    address indexed owner,
    address indexed operator,
    uint256 indexed assetId
